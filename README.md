My boss asked me some questions, mainly about my job preferences. They inquired whether I was interested in an internship or a long-term career with the company. Additionally, they wanted to know my goals and whether I was seeking a part-time or full-time role during the school year. I responded by expressing my interest in a career and a part-time position.

Afterwards, I took the initiative to watch SecurityMetrics to enhance my understanding, prompted by our boss's mention of it. Subsequently, I participated in a team meeting where they acknowledged my performance on GitHub, stating that I was doing well
